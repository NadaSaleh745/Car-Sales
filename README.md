## 🔍 Data Analysis Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning  
- Corrected inconsistent country names.  
- Handled missing and null data for reliable analysis.  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Box Plots:** Detected outliers in car purchase amounts.  
- **Scatter Plots:** Analyzed relationships between purchase amounts, age, salary, and net worth.  
- **Pie Charts:** Visualized gender distribution among car buyers.  

### 3️⃣ Geospatial Mapping  
- Mapped global car sales using latitude & longitude.  
- Created interactive world maps highlighting country-wise sales with Folium.  

### 4️⃣ Correlation Analysis  
- Generated heatmaps to visualize relationships between Age, Credit Card Debt, Annual Salary, Net Worth, and Car Purchase Amount.  

### 5️⃣ Outlier Detection & Removal  
- Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and eliminate outliers, enhancing data integrity.  

### 6️⃣ Machine Learning  
- **Data Preparation:** Selected key features - Age, Annual Salary, Net Worth - and target variable Car Purchase Amount.  
- **Model Training:** Implemented Linear Regression using Scikit-learn.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - R-squared (R²)  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- **Visualization:** Created scatter plots comparing actual vs. predicted purchase amounts for both training and testing sets.  

---

## 💡 Key Insights  
- **Strong Correlations** between annual salary, net worth, and car purchase amounts.  
- **Geographic Trends:** Certain countries exhibited higher car purchase activity.  
- **Predictive Modeling:** The linear regression model showcased good predictive capabilities, identifying key financial indicators influencing purchase decisions.
